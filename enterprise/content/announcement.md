# What does End of Maintenance Mean?
End of maintenance means that Camunda will not perform any maintenance or release any bug fixes and patch releases related to the mentioned version after the specified date.
In case you are planning to migrate to a more recent version of Camunda Platform, check our [Update & Migration Guide](/manual/latest/update/).

Please let us know if you have any concerns or if you need help migrating to a new version.

# Why is Camunda Changing the Support for Environments?
Camunda is committed to delivering improvements and bug fixes as fast as possible. We are also committed to providing world class support for our software running in different environments. However, as new versions of databases, web browsers, etc, are released, the cost of supporting multiple environments grows exponentially, making it harder to provide the level of support our customers have come to expect from us. Therefore, we no longer support environments marked as end-of-life by the vendor, or very old versions that are no longer widely used.
