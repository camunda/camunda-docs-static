This guide is intended to help you navigate our new Camunda Enterprise Customer Portal. This document includes information about how to get access, how to download the license keys, create temporary license keys and manage support contacts for our support JIRA.

Please note that support will continue to be provided via our [JIRA support system](https://jira.camunda.com/projects/SUPPORT/queues).

**Disclaimer**: the Camunda Enterprise Portal is currently in closed beta. If you would like to be part of the beta users, please contact your Customer Success Manager or email customer-success@camunda.com.


## How is the Portal Organized?

The Portal is divided into the following areas:

**Dashboard:** works as the home page of the Portal. In this area, you can:

 * Check out important updates/news (e.g. new product releases)
 * Find quick links to relevant areas/pages (e.g. JIRA, Manuals, Best Practices)
 * Check pinned content

**Content & Resources:** central repository for case studies, blog posts, demos, and other content. You can filter content using the top filters and pin content.

**Playbooks:** compilations of resources available under Content & Resources

**Training & Certification:** area with links to Camunda Academy, Custom Training Requests, and Open Trainings.

**Products & Best Practices:** section that links to Best Practices and Success Paths. Under this section, selected admin users from the customers (enabled by their Customer Success Manager) will be able to access some additional areas:

* **Subscription Overview:** page where admin users can find subscription information (e.g. SLA and SLA Timezone), usage limits (e.g. PIs/DIs/TUs included), and support contact limits (e.g. number of full support contacts included).
    
* **License Key Manager:** area where your companyâ€™s license key(s) will be available to download. Additionally, admin users will be able to create temporary license keys for development (valid for 90 days).
    
* **Support Contact Manager:** page where the admin users can add/remove/edit the support contacts who can access JIRA support.
