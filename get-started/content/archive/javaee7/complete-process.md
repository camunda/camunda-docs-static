# Complete the Process

## Add Prepare Pizza Task Form

{{< img src="../img/prepare-pizza.png" >}}

If the user approves the pizza order the pizza has to be prepared. So we add a user task form in which the user can confirm that preparation of the pizza has been completed.

Go back to Eclipse and add a file named `preparepizza.xhtml` to the `src/main/webapp` folder. Add the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:ui="http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets"
  xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"
  xmlns:f="http://java.sun.com/jsf/core">

<f:view>
  <f:metadata>
    <!-- Start working on a task. Task Id is read internally from
         request parameters and cached in the CDI conversation scope.
    -->

    <f:event type="preRenderView" listener="#{camundaTaskForm.startTaskForm()}" />
  </f:metadata>
  <h:head>
    <title>Prepare Pizza</title>
  </h:head>
  <h:body>
    <h1>Please prepare pizza</h1>
    <h:form id="submitForm">
      <h:commandButton id="submit_button" value="Done" action="#{camundaTaskForm.completeTask()}" />
    </h:form>
  </h:body>
</f:view>
</html>
```

A new conversation is started again before the view is rendered and the task is completed after the form has been submitted. The form only contains a single button.

Open the process with Camunda Modeler. Click on the prepare pizza user task. In the properties view, set the `Form Key` property to `app:preparepizza.jsf`.

When you are done, save all resources, [perform a Maven build](../deploy/#build-the-process-application), and [redeploy](../deploy/#deploy-to-wildfly) the process application.

## Add Send Rejection Email Service Task

If the user disapproves the pizza order an email is sent to inform the customer. This will be simulated by a simple log output.

The EJB `OrderBusinessLogic` is extended with a method `rejectOrder`, which logs an informative message for the rejection of the order.

```html
@Stateless
@Named
public class OrderBusinessLogic {

  // ..

  private static Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(OrderBusinessLogic.class.getName());

  public void persistOrder(DelegateExecution delegateExecution) {
    // ...
  }

  public OrderEntity getOrder(Long orderId) {
    // ...
  }

  public void mergeOrderAndCompleteTask(OrderEntity orderEntity) {
    // ...
  }

  public void rejectOrder(DelegateExecution delegateExecution) {
    OrderEntity order = getOrder((Long) delegateExecution.getVariable("orderId"));
    LOGGER.log(Level.INFO, "\n\n\nSending Email:\nDear {0}, your order {1} of a {2} pizza has been rejected.\n\n\n", new String[]{order.getCustomer(), String.valueOf(order.getId()), order.getPizza()});
  }

}
```

{{< img src="../img/pizza-order-process-send-rejection-email.png" >}}

Open the process with Camunda Modeler. Click on the reject email service task. In the properties view, set the `Expression` property to `${orderBusinessLogic.rejectOrder(execution)}`.

When you are done, save all resources, [perform a Maven build](../deploy/#build-the-process-application) and [redeploy](../deploy/#deploy-to-wildfly) the process application. You can now approve and reject an order in [Tasklist](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist). The output of the `Send Rejection Email` task can be checked by looking into the logfile of the WildFly server. It should state that a rejection email has been sent:

<pre class="console">
  Sending Email:
  Dear asdf, your order 2 of a Margarita pizza has been rejected.
</pre>
