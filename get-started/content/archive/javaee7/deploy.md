The next step consists in building and deploying the process application.


# Build the Process Application

To deploy the process application select the `pom.xml` in the Package Explorer, perform a right-click and select `Run As / Maven Clean` and afterwards `Run As / Maven Install`. This will generate a WAR file named `pizza-order.war` in the `target/` folder of your Maven project.

If the `pizza-order.war` file is not visible after having performed the Maven build, you need to refresh the project (F5) in Eclipse.

# Deploy to WildFly

To deploy the process application, copy and paste the `pizza-order.war` from your Maven project `target` folder to the `$CAMUNDA_HOME/server/wildfly-VERSION/standalone/deployments` folder.

Check the log file of the WildFly server. If you see a log message like the following one, the deployment was successful:

<pre class="console">
