In this section you learn how to create your first BPMN 2.0 process with the Camunda Modeler. Start up the Camunda Modeler now.

# Create a new BPMN Diagram

Create a new BPMN diagram by clicking *File > New File > BPMN Diagram*.

# Start with a Simple Process

Start by modeling a simple process.

{{< img src="../img/modeler-step1.png" >}}

Double-click on the Start Event. A text box opens. Type "Loan Request Received".

{{< note title="Hint" class="info" >}}
When editing Labels, you can add line breaks by hitting `Shift + Enter`.
{{< /note >}}

Click on the start event. From its context menu, select the activity shape (rectangle) and drag it to a good position. Name it *Approve Loan*. Change the activity type to *User Task* by clicking on it and using the wrench button.

Add an End Event named *Loan Request Approved*.

# Configure a User Task

{{< img src="../img/modeler-step4.png" >}}

Next, Open the properties view. If it is not already visible then click on the label on the right hand side of your screen and the properties view will be displayed.

Select the User Task on the canvas. This updates the selection in the properties view. Scroll to the property named `Assignee`.
Type *john*.

When you are done, save your changes.


# Configure Properties for Execution

{{< img src="../img/modeler-step5.png" >}}

Since we are modeling an executable process, we should give it an ID and set the `isExecutable` property to `true`. On the right hand side of the canvas, you find the properties panel. Click on a free spot of the modeling canvas. This displays the properties of the process itself.

First, configure an ID for the process. Type *approve-loan* in the property field *Id*. The property ID is used by the process engine as identifier for the executable process and it is best practice to set it to a human-readable name.

Second, configure the Name of the process. Type *Loan Approval* in the property field *Name*.

Finally, check the box of the *Executable* property. If you do not check this box, the process definition is ignored by the process engine.

# Save the BPMN Diagram

When you are done, save your changes by clicking *File > Save File As..*. In the dialogue that pops up, navigate to the loan application project directory (by default this is in your Eclipse workspace path). In the project directory, place the model in the `src/main/resources` folder.

Return to Eclipse. Right-click the project folder and click *Refresh*. This synchronizes the new BPMN file with Eclipse.
