In the next step, you'll deploy the Process and start a new instance so you can see that your simple process is working correctly.

# Use the Camunda Modeler to Deploy the Process

In order to deploy the Process, click on the deploy button in the Camunda Modeler, then give it the Deployment Name "Payment Retrieval" and click the Deploy button.

{{< img src="../img/modeler-deploy2.png" >}}
You should see a success message in the Camunda Modeler:
{{< img src="../img/modeler-deploy3.png" >}}

# Verify the Deployment with Cockpit

Next, use Cockpit to see if the process was successfully deployed. Go to [http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/cockpit) and log in with the credentials demo / demo. Your process *Payment Retrieval* should be visible on the dashboard.

# Start a Process Instance

In Camunda, there are different ways to start a new process instance.
You can leverage the Camunda REST API to start a new process instance by sending a POST Request.

## a) curl / wget

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"variables": {"amount": {"value":555}, "item": {"value":"item-xyz"} } }' http://localhost:8080/engine-rest/process-definition/key/payment-retrieval/start
```

In your worker, you should now see the output in your console.
This means you have successfully started and executed your first simple process.

## b) Rest Client

If you don't feel comfortable using curl for the REST request, you can instead make use of any REST client.

Make a POST request to the following endpoint:
`http://localhost:8080/engine-rest/process-definition/key/payment-retrieval/start`

The JSON Body should look like this:
```JSON
{
	"variables": {
		"amount": {
			"value":555
		},
		"item": {
			"value": "item-xyz"
		}
	}
}
```

*Hint:* Make sure you are setting the headers correctly to `Content-Type: application/json`


Here's what the request might look like in Postman:

In your worker, you should now see the output in your console.
This means you have successfully started and executed your first simple process.

If you are running on Camunda Enterprise Edition, you can also check out your completed process instance in the Camunda Cockpit.
