In this section, you'll learn how to make your process more dynamic by using BPMN 2.0 *Exclusive Gateways*.

# Add Two Gateways
We want to modify our process so that it's more dynamic.

To do so, open the process in the Camunda Modeler.

Next, from the Modeler's left-hand menu, select the gateway shape (diamond) and drag it into position between between the Start Event and the Service Task. Move the User Task down and add another Gateway after it. Lastly, adjust the Sequence Flows so that the model looks like this:
{{< img src="../img/modeler-gateway1.png" >}}

Now also name the new elements accordingly:

# Configure the Gateways

Next, open the properties panel and select the `<1000 €` Sequence Flow after the Gateway on the canvas. This will update the selection in the properties panel.
Scroll to the property named `Condition Type` and change it to `Expression`. Then input `${amount<1000}` as the Expression.
We are using the [Java Unified Expression Language](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/expression-language/) to evaluate the Gateway.

Next, change the Expressions for the other Sequence Flows, too.

For the `>=1000 €` Sequence Flow, use the Expression `${amount>=1000}`:
{{< img src="../img/modeler-gateway4.png" >}}


For the `Yes` Sequence Flow, use the Expression `${approved}`:
{{< img src="../img/modeler-gateway5.png" >}}

For the `No` Sequence Flow, use the Expression `${!approved}`:
{{< img src="../img/modeler-gateway6.png" >}}

# Deploy the Process

Use the `Deploy` Button in the Camunda Modeler to deploy the updated process to Camunda.

# Work on the Task

Go to Tasklist ([http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist](http://localhost:8080/camunda/app/tasklist)) and log in with the credentials "demo / demo".
Click on the {{< glyphicon name="list-alt" text=" Start process" >}} button to start a process instance for the *Payment Retrieval* Process.
Next, set variables for the process instance using the generic form as we learned in the *User Tasks* section.

{{< img src="../img/start-form-generic.png" >}}

Fill in the form as shown in the screenshot and make sure you use an amount that is larger or equal to 1000 in order to see the User Task *Approve Payment*.
When you are done, click *Start*.

You should see the *Approve Payment* task when you click on *All Tasks*. In this quick start, we're logged into Tasklist as an admin user, and so we can see all tasks associated with our processes. However, it's possible to create [filters in Tasklist](/manual/latest/webapps/tasklist/filters/) to determine which users can see which tasks based on [user authorization](/manual/latest/webapps/admin/authorization-management/) as well as other criteria. 

To work on the task, select the *Form* tab and check the *approved* checkbox so that our payment retrieval gets approved.
We should see that our worker prints something to the console.

Next, repeat the same steps, and this time, reject the payment. You should also create one instance with an amount less than 1000 to confirm that the first gateway works correctly.
