Robotic Process Automation (RPA) orchestration is a use case that leverages capabilities from multiple Camunda product modules. It allows for the orchestration of tasks that are automated using RPA technology and (un)attended bots. Currently, Camunda Platform actively supports UiPath and Automation Anywhere but more RPA vendors will be supported in future versions.
