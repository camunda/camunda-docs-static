After familiarizing yourself with all [Requirements](../requirements), this section will dive deeper into the components involved in RPA Orchestration and how you should set them up. If your setup is already prepared, jump ahead to [Orchestrating RPA Bots](../orchestrating-bots)

# RPA Vendor Credentials

To orchestrate RPA bots, we will connect the Camunda Platform Workflow Engine to your RPA vendor via the Camunda RPA Bridge. 
This component will require configuration parameters to connect to your RPA vendor.

## UiPath

The Camunda RPA Orchestration works with the UiPath Orchestrator in either the [Cloud](https://cloud.uipath.com) or On-Premises (v2019 or v2020.4) distribution. For testing purposes, we recommend using the cloud version.

To prepare the setup of the RPA Bridge, please

* Open the ‘Admin’ view of the UiPath Orchestrator Portal
* Open the ‘API Access’ overlay for your tenant (you might need to expand the tenant with the arrow next to it)
* Copy the values for
  * User Key
  * Account Logical Name
  * Tenant Logical Name
  * Client Id

{{< img src="../img/rpa-uipath-api-access.png" title="UiPath API Access" >}}

Furthermore, the API of UiPath Orchestrator requires a parameter called `organization-unit-id`. In short, this id relates to one specific folder in UiPath Orchestrator that contains the RPA bots you want to orchestrate. In order to obtain it, visit your Orchestrator instance, select the folder you want to work with, and fetch the id from the URL's `fid` parameter.

{{< img src="../img/rpa-uipath-fid.png" title="UiPath Organization Unit ID" >}}

You can read more about this id and how to obtain it in the UiPath documentation on [Building API Requests](https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/reference/building-api-requests). 
Feel free to also visit the [UiPath Forum](https://forum.uipath.com/) for further help.

## Automation Anywhere

The RPA Bridge integrates with Automation 360 (formerly A2019).

To prepare the setup of the RPA Bridge, please

* Create or choose a user with a bot runner license (bots available to this user can be orchestrated in Camunda and the user will be used to run bots)
* Remember the password of that user or alternatively [create an API key](https://docs.automationanywhere.com/bundle/enterprise-v2019/page/enterprise-cloud/topics/control-room/control-room-api/cloud-control-room-apikey-role.html) and write that down

# Camunda Platform Run

Unless you already have a running Camunda Platform 7.14 or later installation, please

* [Download Camunda Run (Enterprise)](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/enterprise-release/camunda-bpm/run/7.16/7.16.0/camunda-bpm-run-ee-7.16.0-ee.zip)

You will be asked for a username and password that you have obtained together with your Enterprise license key.

Once you have downloaded Camunda Run, please

* Unzip the archive
* Launch the platform by executing

```sh
# Windows
start.bat

# Mac OS or Linux
./start.sh
```

Learn more about [Installing Camunda Platform](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/installation/).

# Camunda RPA Bridge

In order to install the RPA Bridge, please:

* [Download the RPA Bridge](https://downloads.camunda.cloud/enterprise-release/camunda-bpm/rpa/1.1/1.1.0/camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge-1.1.0.zip)
* Unzip the archive
* Add your Enterprise license key into a file called `license.txt` in the same folder as the `application.yml` file.

Edit the config file `application.yml`:

* In general, lines starting with a `#` are comments and will not be considered by the Bridge.
* `license-file`: Remove the comment character. The property value should be `file:///${user.dir}/license.txt`.
* `camunda-api`: Adjust the URL and credentials to your Camunda Platform instance if necessary.

### UiPath Cloud

Edit the config file `application.yml`:

* add `#` to the beginning of each line under `automation-anywhere-api`, so it is not considered by the Bridge
* under the `uipath-api` element, adjust the following
  * `url`: set to `https://platform.uipath.com/`
  * `account-name`: the Account Logical Name from the API Access overlay
  * `tenant-name`: the Tenant Logical Name from the API Access overlay
  * `folder-path`: adjust to the name of the folder you want to work with, in case you do **NOT** want to work with a folder called "Default"
  * `organization-unit-id`: see above how to [retrieve your organization unit id](#uipath)
  * under the `authentication` element, adjust the following
    * `type`: 
    * `auth-url`: switch to `https://account.uipath.com/oauth/token`
    * `user`: the Client Id from the API Access overlay
    * `key`: the User Key from the API Access overlay
  * `status-update-method`: set to `polling`
  * `webhook`: add `#` to the beginning of each line under `webhook`, so it is not considered by the Bridge

### UiPath On-Premises

Edit the config file `application.yml`:

* Add `#` to the beginning of each line under `automation-anywhere-api`, so it is not considered by the Bridge.
* Please follow the instructions in the config file related to UiPath On-Premises.
* For a quick start, we recommend using `polling` for the `status-update-method`.

### Automation Anywhere

Edit the config file `application.yml`:

* Add `#` to the beginning of each line under `uipath-api`, so it is not considered by the Bridge
* Under the `automation-anywhere-api` element, adjust the following:
  * `url`: set to the base URL of your Automation Anywhere Controlroom instance
  * `user`: the name of the user with bot runner permissions, this user is starting the bots in your Automation Anywhere instance
  * `password`: the user's password
  * If you want to use an [API key](https://docs.automationanywhere.com/bundle/enterprise-v2019/page/enterprise-cloud/topics/control-room/control-room-api/cloud-authenticate-apikey.html) instead, put a `#` in front of `password`, remove the one in front of `api-key` and add your API key to that property

### Logging configuration

We recommend enabling simple logging by adding this as the last line to `application.yml`:

```
logging.level.org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge.externaltask: DEBUG
```

### Launch the RPA Bridge

Use the following command to launch the Bridge

```sh
java -jar camunda-bpm-rpa-bridge.jar
```

You should see a log message like 

```
External Task Listener started ----
```

For troubleshooting, you can switch to extensive logging by adding this as the last line to `application.yml`:

```
logging.level.org.camunda.bpm.rpa.bridge: DEBUG
```
