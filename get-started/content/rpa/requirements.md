### Knowledge Requirements

In order to succeed with this getting started guide, we expect that you already know

* how to run UiPath robots and trigger them from the UiPath Orchestrator
* how to model and execute BPMN process diagrams with the Camunda stack
* how to work with process variables as part of JUEL expressions

In case you never executed a process model with the Camunda engine, then we recommend to start with the <a href="https://docs.camunda.org/get-started/quick-start/">Quick Start Guide</a> first.

### Hardware Requirements

UiPath only works with Microsoft Windows. If you don't have a dedicated Windows environment, we recommend to use a Windows virtual machine, e.g. using <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">Virtualbox</a>.

Since this guide asks you to install and use several components, we recommend to have a computer with sufficient resources to be able to run everything in parallel. Alternatively, we encourage you to use the hosted SaaS options where available.
