Camunda Optimize allows you to perform all the analytics on a subset of process instances. To do so, you can filter them by 

* their start date:

{{< video src="../video/date-filter.mp4" title="Date Filter">}}

* variable values: 

{{< video src="../video/variable-filter.mp4" title="Date Filter" >}}

* executed flow nodes:
